Please return your solution in the form of a sharable link to a cloud storage location- (Dropbox, Google Drive, Github,, etc.) so that he can share it with the hiring manager.

This assignment should take 2-4 hours.

Design and prototype a car rental system using object-oriented principles. Please focus on delivering the following core features:

 

The system should let a customer reserve a car of a given type at a desired date and time for a given number of days
The number of cars of each type is limited, but customers should be able to reserve a single rental car for multiple, non-overlapping time frames
Provide a Junit test that illustrates the core reservation workflow and demonstrates its correctness
 

Please use Java (or C#) as the implementation language.

 

While the solution should allow for extension to be exposed as a service, please note that

 

No UI needs to be provided
No need to explicitly suspend the solution in a web container, e.g. using spring boot
No need to explicitly integrate the solution with a database
